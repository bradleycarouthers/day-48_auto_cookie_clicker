# day-48_auto_cookie_clicker
Day 48 of 100.

Cookie clicker is a web game where the user, well...clicks the cookie. It's a rapid clicking/idle game that people are fond of. This program opens a web browser (Chrome), goes to the Cookie Clicker site, and plays it for you. This is done via webdriver from the selenium module mostly. Though, time module plays a big part as well, as every 5 seconds the program automatically purchases the highest priced upgrade it can afford. This is all done while the cookie is being clicked rapidly, and after 5minutes, the program stops and prints the cookies per/sec stat.
